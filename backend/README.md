## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- Firebase project with Firestore enabled
- Codeforces account credentials

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Configure your credentials
CF_USERNAME=your_codeforces_username
CF_PASSWORD=your_codeforces_password
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./serviceAccountKey.json
PORT=8000
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Installation & Build
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run production build (scrapes and populates database)
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## 📚 API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints
```http
GET  /api/health                           # System health check
GET  /api/contests/:division               # Get contests by division
GET  /api/contest/:id/problems             # Get contest problems
GET  /api/contest/:id/problem/:index       # Get complete problem data
```

### Premium Features
```http
GET  /api/search/problems?q=:query         # Advanced problem search
GET  /api/problems/trending                # Trending problems
GET  /api/problems/difficulty/:min/:max    # Problems by rating range
GET  /api/problems/random?rating=:rating   # Random problem generator
```

### Admin & Diagnostics
```http
GET  /api/diagnostics                      # System diagnostics
POST /api/admin/reset-circuit-breaker      # Reset scraping circuit breaker
```

## 🏗️ Build Process

The production build process consists of:

1. **Contest Discovery** - Fetch all recent contests from Codeforces API
2. **Problem Scraping** - Extract complete problem data with test cases
3. **Data Optimization** - Process and structure data for fast queries
4. **Index Building** - Create search indices for instant text search
5. **Database Population** - Store everything in Firebase collections
6. **Backup Creation** - Generate comprehensive backups

```bash
# Full production build (30-60 minutes)
npm run build

# Quick incremental build
npm run build-quick

# Test scraper independently
npm run scrape
```

## 🛡️ Security & Reliability

### Cloudflare Bypass Techniques
- Advanced browser fingerprint randomization
- Residential proxy rotation support
- Human-like interaction patterns
- Dynamic CAPTCHA solving capabilities

### Error Handling
- Circuit breaker pattern for scraping failures
- Graceful fallback to Codeforces API
- Comprehensive error logging and recovery
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Performance Optimizations
- Firebase-first data architecture
- Intelligent caching strategies
- Pre-computed search indices
- Optimized data structures

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Health Checks
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# View diagnostics
curl http://localhost:8000/api/diagnostics
```

### Performance Metrics
- Response time monitoring
- Success/failure rates
- Cache hit ratios
- Scraping statistics

## 🎯 Production Deployment

### Docker Support
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Environment Variables
- `CF_USERNAME` - Codeforces username
- `CF_PASSWORD` - Codeforces password  
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` - Firebase service account key
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 8000)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (production/development)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **403 Forbidden** - IP blocked by Cloudflare
   - Wait 15-30 minutes and retry
   - Use VPN or proxy rotation
   
2. **Navigation Timeout** - Slow connection
   - Increase timeout values
   - Check network connectivity
   
3. **Login Required** - Contest restrictions
   - Verify credentials in .env
   - Check account status

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test startup sequence
npm run startup

# Check system health
npm run health

# Reset circuit breaker
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/admin/reset-circuit-breaker
```

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

- **Contest listing**: < 50ms response time
- **Problem data**: < 100ms for cached, < 5s for fresh scrape
- **Search queries**: < 30ms response time
- **Success rate**: > 95% uptime with proper configuration
